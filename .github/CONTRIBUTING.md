# How to Contribute

All contributions are welcome as long as they relate to the mission statement of this repository and do not outright replace functionality, features or configuration.

In short, the rules for contributing are simple:

 1. Be nice.

While it is impossible (and not entirely reasonable) to block the use of GenAI, only human interactions are allowed. You can of course use GenAI tools to work on the contribution, 
but as you as a person are responsible for its products, the assumption of humanity is to be enforced.
